This project is a snippet of the webapp that we intend to build to increase constitutional literacy(parts 5 and 6), which right now includes two interactive games and a basic chatbot, currently deployed on GitHub Pages. The goal is to transition this static prototype into a dynamic React-based application, enhancing its structure and interactivity.
